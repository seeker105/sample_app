<!-- TODO it says that Rails knows to defer the rendering of @feed_items to the 'microposts' partial
because of the class 'microposts' on the ordered list. How exactly does that work? How do I know
when I'm writing a declaration the correct way to set up what I want it to do? -->
<% if @feed_items.any? %>
  <ol class="microposts"
    <%= render @feed_items %>
  </ol>
  <%= will_paginate @feed_items %>
<% end %>
